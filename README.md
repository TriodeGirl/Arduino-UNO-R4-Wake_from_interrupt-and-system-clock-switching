Arduino UNO R4 test-code to demonstrate:
  1. Wake-From-Interrupt
  2. Change System-Clock divisors 1/1, 1/16, and 1/64 settings 
  3. Switching between 48MHz HOCO and 8MHz MOCO internal oscillators (and PLL with XTAL if fitted)
  4. USB Module Disable (with code initiated Reset after timeout delay)
